    <string name="tonoftext">In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank
God, only material things. Values have shrunk to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability
to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the
means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial
enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; and the savings of
many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens
face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a
foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.
And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of
locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and
were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and
human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes
in the very sight of the supply.
Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind\'s goods have failed, through
their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have
abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public
opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.
True, they have tried. But their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition.
Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the
lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted
to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They only know the rules of a
generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people
perish.
Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We
may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of that restoration lies in the
extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.
Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the
thrill of creative effort. The joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in
the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost
us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to
ourselves, to our fellow men.</string>
